                    NASA's Galileo spacecraft took this image of Earth's Moon on Dec. 7, 1992, on its way to explore the
                    Jupiter system in 1995-97. The distinct bright ray crater at the bottom of the image is the Tycho
                    impact
                    basin.</p>

                <p>Astronaut Harrison Schmitt standing next to boulder during third EVA
                    AS17-146-22294 (13 Dec. 1972) --- Scientist-astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt is photographed working
                    beside
                    a huge boulder at Station 6 (base of North Massif) during the third Apollo 17 extravehicular
                    activity
                    (EVA) at the Taurus-Littrow landing site. The front portion of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) is
                    visible
                    on the left. This picture was taken by astronaut Eugene A. Cernan, Apollo 17 commander. Schmitt is
                    the
                    lunar module pilot. While astronauts Cernan and Schmitt descended in the Lunar Module (LM)
                    "Challenger"
                    to explore the moon, astronaut Ronald E. Evans, command module pilot, remained with the Apollo 17
                    Command and Service Modules (CSM) in lunar orbit.</p>

                <h3>Saturn Apollo Program</h3>
                <p>Saturn Apollo Program
                    The second manned lunar landing mission, Apollo 12 launched from launch pad 39-A at Kennedy Space
                    Center
                    in Florida on November 14, 1969 via a Saturn Five launch vehicle. The Saturn V vehicle was developed
                    by
                    the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) under the direction of Dr. Wernher von Braun. Aboard Apollo
                    12
                    was a crew of three astronauts: Alan L. Bean, pilot of the Lunar Module (LM), Intrepid; Richard
                    Gordon,
                    pilot of the Command Module (CM), Yankee Clipper; and Spacecraft Commander Charles Conrad. The LM,
                    Intrepid, landed astronauts Conrad and Bean on the lunar surface in what’s known as the Ocean of
                    Storms
                    while astronaut Richard Gordon piloted the CM, Yankee Clipper, in a parking orbit around the Moon.
                    Their
                    lunar soil activities included the deployment of the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package
                    (ALSEP),
                    finding the unmanned Surveyor 3 that landed on the Moon on April 19, 1967, and collecting 75 pounds
                    (34
                    kilograms) of rock samples. In this photograph, one of the astronauts on the Moon’s surface is
                    holding a
                    container of lunar soil. The other astronaut is seen reflected in his helmet. Apollo 12 safely
                    returned
                    to Earth on November 24, 1969.</p>

                <p>2017 Total Solar Eclipse
                    During the total solar eclipse, the Sun’s corona, only visible during the total eclipse, is shown as
                    a
                    crown of white flares from the surface. The red spots called Bailey's beads occurs where the moon
                    grazes
                    by the Sun and the rugged lunar limb topography allows beads of sunlight to shine through in some
                    areas
                    as photographed from NASA Armstrong’s Gulfstream III.</p>
