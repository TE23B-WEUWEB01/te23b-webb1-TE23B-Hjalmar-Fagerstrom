        <p>Slaughter to Prevail is a Russian deathcore band based in Orlando, Florida.[1] The group debuted with an EP entitled Chapters of Misery in 2015, followed by a full-length album, Misery Sermon, in 2017. Their second album, Kostolom, was released in 2021. The band is currently signed to Sumerian Records and have toured throughout the US, Europe,[2][3] Canada, and Asia.[4] The band has had numerous line-up changes over the years, with vocalist Alex Terrible and guitarist Jack Simmons as the sole consistent members.</p>
        <p>Jack Simmons was a member of London-based deathcore act Acrania, while Alex Terrible (Aleksandr Shikolay) had gained a cult following online for his vocal covers on YouTube. Terrible was also a member of the Russian deathcore act We Are Obscurity, which disbanded after failing to find a record label.[citation needed] Former We Are Obscurity members Maxim Zadorin (guitar) and drummer Anton Poddyachy (drums) later became part of the initial lineup of Slaughter to Prevail, along with Slava Antonenko (guitar) and Filipp Kucheryavyh (bass).[5][6] Zadorin left the band very early on and was replaced by his former We Are Obscurity bandmate Dimmitry Mamedov.</p>
